Habitat 0.75.0 Release Notes

We are happy to announce the release of Chef Habitat 0.75.0. We have a number of new features as well
as bug fixes, so please read on for all the details. If you just want the binaries, head on over to
[Install Chef Habitat](https://www.habitat.sh//docs/install-habitat/install-cli).

Highlights

#### Improvements to 'hab bldr job status'

We recently added the ability to build Windows packages on [Builder](https://forums.habitat.sh/t/announcing-windows-builds-support-in-habitat-builder/1003)!
`hab bldr job status` will now report the Package Target (x86_64-linux, x86_64-windows) of the build group.
This improves the usability of the command when introducing a change that results in builds for more than one Package Target.

#### Subdirectory support in Plan 'config'

A frequent request is support for subdirectories in the `config` directory for a service packaged with Chef Habitat.
[#6066](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/pull/6066) introduces support for this capability. This allows you to
structure configuration for your software in the way it expects.

#### Chef Habitat Launcher: New Version Released, Please Update

This release of Chef Habitat includes a new release of the Launcher, a small binary that the Supervisor uses
to help manage its supervised processes. Whereas the Supervisor is able to automatically update itself,
the Launcher is currently released a bit differently, by design; it should be rare that the Launcher ever
needs to change. To update your Launchers, you will need to run hab pkg install core/hab-launcher on each
machine that has a Supervisor, and then restart your Supervisor. This will, by necessity, require a restart
of supervised services, so factor that into your planning.

Thanks again for using Chef Habitat!
