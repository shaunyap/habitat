We are happy to announce the release of Chef Habitat 0.55.0. We have a number of new features as well as bug fixes, so please read on for all the details. If you just want the binaries, head on over to [Install Chef Habitat](https://www.habitat.sh/docs/using-habitat/install-habitat). Thanks again for using Chef Habitat!

## Highlights:

* [Feature] Ability to create and upload secrets via the hab cli
* [Feature] Improve startup time of Windows container studios
* [Feature] Windows container Studio runs its background supervisor as a service
* [Bugfix] Windows Supervisor honors a plan's pkg_svc_user
* [Bugfix] Windows container Studio correctly streams Supervisor output from Get-SupervisorLog
* [Bugfix] Updated default.toml files are seen on package update (fixes [#4576](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/issues/4576))
* [Bugfix] Launcher now reaps orphaned zombie processes (fixes [#4412](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/issues/4412))

### Chef Habitat Origin Secrets

In a previous release we enabled users to pass in secrets to the studio. With this release, you can now create secrets for your Chef Habitat origin in Builder. These secrets are encrypted locally before they are uploaded to Builder. *Only* Builder can decrypt these secrets. Once a secret is attached to your origin it will be passed into your Builder jobs as part of the build. This is really useful for things like ssh keys, AWS credentials etc.

#### Usage

```
hab origin secret upload <KEY> <VALUE>
hab origin secret list
hab origin secret delete <KEY>
```
### Chef Habitat Launcher: New Version Released, Please Update

This release of Chef Habitat includes a new release of the Launcher, a small binary that the Supervisor uses to help manage its supervised  processes. Whereas the Supervisor is able to automatically update itself, the Launcher is currently released a bit differently, by design;  it should be rare that the Launcher ever needs to change. To update your Launchers, you will need to run `hab pkg install core/hab-launcher` on each machine that has a Supervisor, and then restart your  Supervisor. This will, by necessity, require a restart of supervised  services, so factor that into your planning.

While we always recommend using the latest code, this Launcher is of particular interest for Linux users that may be running the Launcher as PID 1 in non-container deployments. If that applies to you, you'll want to upgrade to take advantage of the Launcher's new zombie reaping capabilities. Users running Chef Habitat packages in exported Docker containers will only need to re-export their packages to use the new Launcher. If neither applies to you, then updating the Launcher is not strictly required at this time, but please plan to update at your earliest convenience.
