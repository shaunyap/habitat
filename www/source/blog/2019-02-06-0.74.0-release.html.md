Habitat 0.74.0 Release Notes

We are happy to announce the release of Chef Habitat v0.74.0. We have a number of
new features as well as bug fixes, so please read on for all the details. We
have a small behavioral change for Windows users when building packages, for
more details read on! If you just want the binaries, head on over to [Install
Chef Habitat](https://www.habitat.sh//docs/install-habitat/install-cli).

Thanks again for using Chef Habitat!

Highlights:

#### Windows Build Change: Set results folder in current directory

One change to the Windows build system in 0.74.0 changes the location of the
`results` folder where the final `hart` file is saved upon a successful build.
Until 0.74.0, the `results` folder would always exist under the folder where
the `plan.ps1` file is located. We have changed this location so that the
`results` folder is created inside the current working directory. Thus the
`results` folder will exist in the same directory from wherever you call
`build` if you are inside of a Studio or from where you call `hab pkg build`.

The reason for this change is that this aligns the Powershell build behavior
with the Bash based behavior for `plan.sh` based plans. We make an effort to
align these behaviors in order to simplify the overall behavior of any Chef Habitat
build and align expectations and documentation around the Chef Habitat build system
in general. The particular detail of the `results` folder location came to
light as we have been working on adding Windows builder workers to our public
Chef Habitat CI offering.

If you have built CI infrastructure around Windows based Chef Habitat builds, this
change may impact you if you invoke a build from a location above the immediate
folder where your `plan.ps1` is located. If you typically run `build` from the
same directory where the `plan.ps1` is located, this change should have no
affect.

#### A new install hook

A new and unique hook has been introduced in this release that runs when a
package is installed. Head over to the [Introducting the Install
Hook](/blog/2019/02/introducing-the-install-hook) blog post for more details.
