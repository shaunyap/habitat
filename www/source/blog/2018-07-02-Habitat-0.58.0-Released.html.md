## Chef Habitat Launcher: New Version Released, Please Update
This release of Chef Habitat includes a new release of the Launcher, a small binary that the Supervisor uses to help manage its supervised processes. Whereas the Supervisor is able to automatically update itself, the Launcher is currently released a bit differently, by design; it should be rare that the Launcher ever needs to change. To update your Launchers, you will need to run `hab pkg install core/hab-launcher` on each machine that has a Supervisor, and then restart your Supervisor. This will, by necessity, require a restart of supervised services, so factor that into your planning.
