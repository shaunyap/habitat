We are happy to announce the release of Chef Habitat 0.56.0. We have a number of new features as well as bug fixes, so please read on for all the details. If you just want the binaries, head on over to [Install Chef Habitat](https://www.habitat.sh//docs/install-habitat/install-cli). Thanks again for using Chef Habitat!

## Highlights:

- Remote command-and-control of the Supervisor
- "Relaxed" binding mode
- JSON logging output
- Additional configuration environment variables for the Chef Habitat CLI
- Fix `hab origin key upload` arguments
- Bind validation
- Various templating improvements
- Improvements to `hab bldr job status`

### Remote Command-and-Control of the Supervisor
The largest change in this release is a reworking of the interaction protocol between the `hab` CLI and the Supervisor. Previously, this was accomplished mainly by communicating through the filesystem, which ultimately limits the things that we can make the Supervisor do. Now, `hab` communicates with the Supervisor via a defined TCP protocol, which lays the foundation for a number of exciting capabilities weâ€™ll be rolling out in the coming months. A new capability that is immediately available, though, is the ability to communicate remotely with your Supervisors!

There will be some actions that users will need to take to properly use the new Supervisor; for details, please read [our blog post on the topic](https://www.habitat.sh/blog/2018/05/changes-in-the-0.56.0-supervisor/).

## "Relaxed" binding mode
If your service can tolerate starting in the absence of its binds being satisfied, you can now start it with `--binding-mode=relaxed`. When your binds become satisfied, your application can reconfigure itself to take this into account. The default behavior is to still block service startup until all binds are satisfied; this can be explicitly requested with `--binding-mode=strict`. Note however that before Chef Habitat reaches version 1.0, the default will change to `--binding-mode=relaxed`, so please plan accordingly.

### JSON Logging Output
The Supervisor can now output JSON-formatted logs! Just add `--json-logging` when you start the Supervisor.

* [https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/pull/5033](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/pull/5033)

### Additional configuration environment variables
New environment variables are now available:
`HAB_CLIENT_SOCKET_TIMEOUT` - this allows configuration of socket timeout for the Chef Habitat client.  The default is 120 seconds. It can be useful when dealing with uploads of large hart files.
`HAB_SSL_CERT_VERIFY_NONE` - if this is set, the Chef Habitat client will not attempt to verify the SSL certificate when connecting to a depot. This can be useful if authenticating against an on-premise hosted Builder depot, which is configured with a self-signed SSL certificate, or for testing purposes.

* [https://github.com/habitat-sh/core/pull/29](https://github.com/habitat-sh/core/pull/29)

### Fix hab origin key upload arguments
The `hab origin key upload` command was not able to execute correctly since it required two arguments that were mutually exclusive.  This has been fixed by making the arguments optional.

* [https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/pull/5013](https://github.com/habitat-sh/habitat/pull/5013)

### Bind Validation
As part of the relaxed binding mode work, we now are able to validate binding contracts at runtime. This means that if the service group you bind does not satisfy the expected contract, we will log this, and (more importantly), not register the bind as being satisfied. This is rechecked as the service runs, as well.

## Various Templating Improvements
After some internal reworking, we have several important improvements to our templating data, all of which should result in templates that are more clear and easier to reason about.

First, the `members` list of a service group now only contains live and suspect members; you no longer need to use the `eachAlive` helper to filter out dead and departed members.

Next, the leader of a service group can now be accessed directly using the `leader` key. Previously, it was available under the `first` key, but only if the group was running under a leader topology (it was just a regular member otherwise). If the group has no leader, then this key will be `null`, allowing you to use it in boolean checks to streamline your templates.

Third, when a binding group has no live or suspect members, it will be removed from the templating data. This allows your service to easily respond when it has binds that go away while it is running.

Finally, as a result of the internal refactoring, we now are able to define the template rendering data using JSON Schema. Additionally, the documentation on the website is automatically generated from this same schema.

### Improvements to `hab bldr job status`
There are a number of key improvements to the `hab bldr job status` command. In addition to being much faster to execute when fetching status for an origin, it also has improvements in the output rendering, and additional options for formating.

### Chef Habitat Launcher: New Version Released, Please Update
This release of Chef Habitat includes a new release of the Launcher, a small binary that the Supervisor uses to help manage its supervised processes. Whereas the Supervisor is able to automatically update itself, the Launcher is currently released a bit differently, by design; it should be rare that the Launcher ever needs to change. To update your Launchers, you will need to run `hab pkg install core/hab-launcher` on each machine that has a Supervisor, and then restart your Supervisor. This will, by necessity, require a restart of supervised services, so factor that into your planning.
